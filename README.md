# Big-Integer
This C++ program provides an implementation of a BigInt class for handling large integer values. It allows arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on integers of arbitrary size.
BigInt class is used for the mathematical operations that involve very big integer calculations that are
outside the limit of all available primitive data types. For example, a factorial of 100 contains 158 digits
in it so we canâ€™t store it in any primitive data type available. We can store as large an Integer as we want
in it.

Features
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of large integers.
Implements comparison operators for BigInt objects.
Provides conversion to and from standard integer types.
Handles both positive and negative integers.
Known Issues
Multiplication of very large integers may result in incorrect values. This issue is being investigated and will be fixed in future updates.
Contributions
Contributions to improve the BigInt implementation are welcome. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
