# Big-Integer
BigInt class is used for the mathematical operations that involve very big integer calculations that are
outside the limit of all available primitive data types. For example, a factorial of 100 contains 158 digits
in it so we can’t store it in any primitive data type available. We can store as large an Integer as we want
in it.
Your goal is to overload the operators for a generic “BigInt” class. You will need to write two files
(BigInt.h and BigInt.cpp). Your implemented class must fully provide the definitions of following class
(interface) functions .
